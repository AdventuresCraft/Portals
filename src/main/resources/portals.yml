### Portals ###
#
# This is how it goes:
#  You can name the portal anything you want. In the example it's named 'example'
#    Just give each portal a different name.
#  Define whether it's along the X or Z dimension.
#  Next, define its shape. The leftmost column is the lowest X or Z (depending on horizontalByX)
#  Define it's lowest X Y and Z values and the world it's in.
#  target is the server it will send players to
#  permission can be ANY NODE you want it to check. 
#    I suggest not choosing one used by another plugin as that can have bad results depending on load order
#    By default any node you give will be true for ops only unless otherwise granted,
#      except for "portals.everyone" which is true for everyone automagically
#
# Enjoy! :3

example:
  horizontalByX: true
  shape: |
    XOOX
    OOOO
    OOOO
    XOOX
  world: 'world'
  x: 100 # Lowest X
  y: 70 # Lowest Y
  z: 100 # Lowest Z
  target: hub # Target server
  permission: portals.everyone # Can be ANY node, not just portals.something. portals.everyone is true by default
